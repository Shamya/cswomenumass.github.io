Shamya is a first year graduate student at CICS. Her research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence for Education and is being advised by Prof Beverly Woolf at the CKC lab. She believes that a true success of a community is in its power of embracing diversity. 
She worked at Cisco for 4 years before switching gears back to grad school. Trekking in the Himalayan peaks and western ghat of India had been her favorite pastime until recently it was replaced by Mt Sugarloaf in her backyard.
